ABOUT
         offscan.pl - A perl script used for large scale profiling possible
                      target sites of CRISPR/CAS9 system by using seqmap

VERSION
         Version: 1.4
         Oct 31, 2016

SYNOPSIS
         $ perl ./offscan.pl <option>
         For usage, type './offscan.pl -h'
         To test a demo, type './offscan.pl -t'

DESCRIPTION
         This script takes a FASTA file of the target sites and queries the
         reference database by seqmap tolerant designated mismatches, and gives
         the human readable and computer mineable target/off target sites and
         flanking sequencing, also the summary file.

         Seqmap is describled:

         oligonucleotides to the genome, Bioinformatics, 24(20):2395-2396.
         And available at http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jianghui/seqmap/

         This script is used in the following research:

         genome editing in Xenopus tropicalis. Development, 141(3):707-714.

NOTE
         1. Max number of mismatch (option -n) is 5.
         2. The type memory size (option -m) is a number. Unit: megabyte.
         3. User can download the latest seqmap and replace the one included in
            directory 'bin'.
